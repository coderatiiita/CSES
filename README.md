# CSES Solutions

This repository collects personal C++ solutions for tasks from the
[CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/list/).  The code is organised
into topic directories and each problem lives in its own source file.

## Directory overview

- `Introductory Problems/` – solutions for the introductory section.
- `Dynamic Programming/` – exercises dealing with DP techniques.
- `Trees/` – solutions for tree based problems.

## Building a solution

Any source file can be compiled with a modern C++ compiler.  For example:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -O2 -pipe your_file.cpp -o your_program
```
